\section{IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS}

Our system has been implemented on top of Apache Flink and Apcache Kafka frameworks. Each of the three sub-modules described in Section  ~\ref{sec:architecture} have been implemented as Flink Job or operation. Algorithm ~\ref{algonline:flink1} shows how the system's workflow  is implemented as pipeline in Flink.
