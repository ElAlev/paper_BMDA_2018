We follow the terminology of \cite{luckham2008power,alevizos2015complex,zhou2015pattern} to formalize the problem we tackle. Given a set of $K$ real-time streams of events $S = \{ s_1,s_2, ..., s_k\}$ as input, which are associated with a set of $K$  objects $O = \{ o_1, ..., o_k\}$. Where each stream $s_i=\langle e_1,e_3...,e_t,...\rangle$  is a time-ordered sequence of events, these events are connected to a single reference object $o_i \in O$,  $e_t$  refers to the current time event within the unbounded stream, we give the definition of the input event sample as follows:  
\begin{definition}
	Each event is defined as a tuple of attributes $e_i = (type,\tau,a_1,a_2.....,a_n,id)$:  where $type$ is the event type attribute that takes a value from a set of finite event types/symbols $\Sigma$, $\tau$ represents the timestamp of the event tuple,  the  $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$ are spatial or other contextual features (e.g., speed), these features are varying from one application domain to another, while the $id$ attribute connects the event tuple to an associated domain object.
\end{definition}

A user-defined pattern $\mathcal{P}$ is given in the form of regular expression over $\Sigma$ (i.e., event types) \cite{alevizos2017event}, and the main goal is to predict the full matches of $\mathcal{P}$ within each event stream $s_i\in S$ in real-time.

\par The setting that is considered in this work is described in the following:\\
A large-scale patterns prediction over multiple input event streams system that  consists of $K=\left\vert{S}\right\vert=\left\vert{O}\right\vert$ distributed predictor nodes $n_1,n_2...,n_k$, each of which consumes an input event stream $s_i\in S$ and provide an online predication service. Each node $i \in [K]$ consumes a single event stream $s_i$ associated with a single object $o_i \in O$, in addition,  it  maintains a local prediction model $f_i$ for the user-defined pattern $\mathcal{P}$. The online predictions about the full match of  the pattern $\mathcal{P}$ in $s_i$ is provided for each new arriving event tuple, based on the current received event $ \ e_t \in s_i \ $ and the observed previous events sequence $\{e_j \in s_i \mid  j \text{ <} t\}$. In summary, we have multiple running instances of an online prediction algorithm on distributed nodes for multiple input event streams, each instance  provides online predications about a defined pattern of events.  We consider massive event streams that describe trajectories of  moving objects, more specifically, event streams of moving vessels in the context of maritime surveillance.  

The defined pattern $\mathcal{P}$ is monitored over each event stream $s_i$  by a  predictor nodes  $n_i$  that maintains a local prediction model $f_i$, where there is one node for each vessel's event stream.  The prediction model $f_i$ gives the ability to provide an online predictions about when the pattern will be completed in the form of an expected number of future events before a full match does occur.

\subsection{The Proposed Approach}
\par We design and develop a scalable and distributed patterns prediction system over massive input event streams of moving objects. We  exploit the event forecasting with Pattern Markov Chains \cite{alevizos2017event} as the base prediction model (i.e., $f_i$). We propose to enable the dynamic merge of the prediction models of the input event streams, by adapting the distributed online predication protocol \cite{dekel2012optimal,kamp2014communication} to synchronize the distributed  prediction models, i.e., Markov transitions probabilities of the Pattern Markov Chain (PMC) predictors.

\par We propose a $synchronization operation$  for the distributed Pattern Markov Chain (PMC) models based on the maximum-likelihood estimation \citep{anderson1957statistical} for the transition probabilities matrix of the underlaying Markov Chain described by: 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pi_estim}
\hat{p}_{i,j}=\frac{\sum_{k \in K} n_{k,i,j}}{\sum_{k \in K} \sum_{l \in L} n_{k,i,l}}
\end{equation}


\par Our approach relies on enabling the collaborative learning between the prediction models of  the input event streams. By doing so, we assume that the underlying event streams belong to the same  distribution and share the same behavior (e.g., mobility patterns). We claim that assumption is reasonable in many application domains, for instance, in the context of maritime surveillance, vessels travel through defined routes by International Maritime Organization (IMO). Additionally, vessels have similar mobility patterns in specific areas such as moving with low speed and multiple turns near the ports \cite{pallotta2013vessel,liu2014knowledge}. That allows our system to dynamically construct a coherent global prediction model for all input event streams based on merging its local models.

\par Our proposed approach is imposing a speed up in the learning of the prediction models with less training data, in addition, we expect to gain an improvement of the predictive performance compared to the no-distributed  version of event forecasting with Pattern Markov Chains system.
